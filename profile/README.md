This project is part of the Project 1 and Project 2 courses at KMITL. IPCA is a web application designed for managing programming labs in courses like Computer Programming, Data Structure, and more. Inspired by the existing platforms, PLMS (the original version) and PLMS 1.0 (an updated version developed by previous students), we revamped the entire tech stack and added new features to improve functionality and user experience.

## üöß Roadmap
- [ ] Improve UX/UI for better user experience and interface design.
- [ ] Support for two languages: Thai and English.
- [ ] Add C language compiler for coding exercises.
- [ ] Implement Exam Mode for assessments and exams.
- [ ] Create a dashboard for data visualization.
- [ ] Introduce a new user type called Executive for executives to view overview data.
- [ ] Migrate the service worker from Go to Rust for better performance and efficiency.
- [ ] Integrate AI to generate and select coding problems.
- [ ] Provide a problem pool for practice before exams or for self-improvement.
- [ ] Implement a hint system for solving problems, possibly with a penalty (e.g., deducting 1 point for using a hint).
- [ ] Add a ranking system to track user performance.
- [ ] Display code performance metrics, such as execution time, memory usage, and more.
- [ ] Develop a Playground feature for an online compiler, similar to Programiz.
- [ ] Provide solutions for coding problems to help users understand the correct approach.
- [ ] Offer lessons for each topic that users can learn directly on the website.
